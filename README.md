# FCC-local-weather 

This pen is one of my freeCodeCamp projects. It is intended to display the local weather augmented by relevant icons, backgrounds and a possibility to show the temperature in either metric or imperial system.

A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/viorell91/pen/KgqPyo.
